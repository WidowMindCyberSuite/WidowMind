# WidowMind üï∑Ô∏è

**WidowMind** is a modular cybersecurity framework built for the future of autonomous digital defense. Its first core module, **Arachnocore**, is a lightweight, adaptive threat-detection system powered by Python.

> _‚ÄúDigital instincts. Autonomous defense. Evolving protection.‚Äù_

## üß† Project Phase: Arachnocore

**Arachnocore** is the central nervous system ‚Äî a swarm of mini-agents ("spiders") that monitor:
- System processes
- Network ports and packets
- File system changes
- Behavioral anomalies

These agents report to a local core AI that:
- Scores threats
- Logs incidents
- (Future) Evolves responses over time

---

## üîß Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- SQLite (lightweight local threat logging)
- Flask (optional dashboard)
- Scapy, psutil (monitoring)
- YAML (config)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD ‚Äî planned)

---

## üí° Philosophy

Inspired by military logic and swarm intelligence, WidowMind doesn‚Äôt just react ‚Äî it evolves. Arachnocore will form the foundation for a full suite of adaptive cybersecurity tools including:

- üîç Forensic logging
- üß¨ AI-based learning modules
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Auto-recovery agents
- üåê Distributed digital sentinels

## üì¶ Modules (in progress)

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `agents/` | Spider-like monitors (network, file, system) |
| `core/` | The threat brain ‚Äî logic, scoring, response |
| `database/` | Local SQLite logging |
| `dashboard/` | (Optional) Web-based threat visualization |
| `config/` | YAML config files for agent tuning |
