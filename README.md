WidowMind is a next-generation autonomous cybersecurity platform designed to defend, adapt, and evolve.

Powered by a lightweight distributed agent system and an AI-enhanced core, WidowMind proactively detects threats, neutralizes risks, and synchronizes real-time threat intelligence across Windows, Linux, and future macOS and mobile environments.

Built for scalability and resilience from the ground up, WidowMind leverages modern cloud-native deployment strategies with Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines, Nginx secure proxying, and hardened API-driven communications protected by SSL.

Key Features:

Multi-Platform Agents (Windows, Linux, Mac Coming Soon)

AI-Enhanced Threat Analysis (Arachnocore Brain)

Secure Agent-to-Core Communication (SSL/TLS Encrypted APIs)

Dynamic Threat Response Modules (Recluse Auto-Neutralizer)

Real-Time Threat Dashboard and Analytics

Self-Updating Architecture via GitHub Actions + DockerHub

Inspired by swarm intelligence, military logic, and autonomous digital instincts, WidowMind isn’t just another security platform — it’s a living, evolving, cyber defense organism.
